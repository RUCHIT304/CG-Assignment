# CG-Assignment
The main aim of the Rotating Logo Computer Graphics Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre- built functions in OpenGL. The simulation of a Rotating Spiderman Logo is being done using computer graphics.

 The development of the program has large scope to learn computer graphics and visualization from scratch. We will be using OpenGL utility toolkit to implement the algorithm, written in C++ language.
